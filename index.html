     Hops are the flowers of the hop plant, Humulus lupulus. They are used primarily as a bittering, flavouring, and stability agent in beer, and they impart floral, fruity, or citrus flavours and aromas. Before this period, brewers used a "gruit", composed of a wide variety of bitter herbs and flowers. Historically, traditional herb combinations for beers were believed to have been abandoned when beers made with hops were noticed to be less prone to spoilage.
